# iPadStack
One of the biggest challenges for me was to be able to develop on my iPad.
The iPad is a capable machine and many say that its software is lacking, but i beg to differ.
it is a different take on mobile computing.

I was stuck for a long time trying to fit the current stacks and build tools to ios.
for the most part it didnt work.
on my search i found several apps which gave me hope, ISH.app, play.js and others.
but it was not exactly what i was searching for, and then i figured that i might need to change
my thinking. we dont need to bring the build tools to the iPad, there are so many options, 
with a little research we can adjust the stack and still maintain a nice file structure and 
use modules and react and transpiling, it just has to be in the browser.

of course its less than ideal, and wont work on huge apps, but for prototyping or even small scale websites
it might be wonderful.

My plan is to provide some examples here in the repo with some detailes on my workflow and in addition
create a Youtube video that explains and shows how i develop on the iPad.

## The apps i use
1. Working Copy - it is a git manager and also a file editor
2. textastic - file editor

both are paid apps (working copy is free but has inapp purchase of pro features)

for the actual development, any of them is sufficient, but if you need git youll need working copy.
if google drive or dropbox is enough for you then textastic would be a wonderful choice.
i have both apps and use them both, working copy for git management and textastic for
the actual code writing and preview/debugging of my work.

you must understand this is by no means a desktop class development environment, at the moment, the 
debugging capabilities are close to non existent. but still i like to be able to develop
my widgets and components without opening a laptop.

## how to use
you can simply fork or clone the repository and start coding.
